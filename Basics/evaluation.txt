Evaluation a variable

* By default value of var/let variable in undefined
* If any variable is used without declaration then it throws reference error.
* undefined behaves like false if used in boolean context

* undefined converts to NAN if used with numberic value i.e.
    var c;
    c*2 = NAN

* when you evaluate null it behaves as 0 in numberic context and false in boolean context.
