Using words like foo bar make you focus on the concept rather then  graps based on the term you know.
for example

public abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void speak();    
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public void speak()
    {
        console.log("bark");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public void speak()
    {
        console.log("meaun");
    }    
}

in above example you were not focus on the concepts because your mind knows something about it thats why your focus shifted.
Now lets try to understand following

public abstract class foo
{
    public abstact void start();    
}

public class bar : foo
{
    public void start()
    {
        console.log("bar start");
    }
}

public class baz : foo
{
    public void start()
    {
        console.log("baz start")        
    } 
}

this time you must be much focused on concept not on content
